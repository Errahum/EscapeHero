5. Remember to turn on instancing on materials yourself and add post-processing!

6. Please make sure that your project is set to use the linear color space in Edit -> Project Settings -> Player.

7. In case the 4k textures get reverted to 2k, set them to 4k manually!

8. Please don't change the mesh normal, all meshes have custom vertex normals applied, if changed, the normal maps won't work properly!

9. Enjoy my free samples!
